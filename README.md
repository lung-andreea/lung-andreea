### 👋 Hi, I'm Andreea

I am a frontend developer with **5+ years of experience** working on customer-facing enterprise products. I believe in ownership, code quality above all and creating delightful user experiences for customers.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building up a portofolio of small React.js/Node.js projects to feature on my personal website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Node.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Three.js and AWS
- 🤔 My immediate goal is to become a full-stack engineer, so that I get more bandwidth as a professional.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on contributing to React and JS based projects.
- 💬 Ask me anything about React, frontend engineering or career in general.
- 📫 How to reach me: [andreea.lung.outreach@gmail.com](mailto:andreea.lung.outreach@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've always used a Pikatchu profile pic at all the places I've worked, but I've never watched the whole Pokemon series

- 🛠️ Solving problems for stakeholders
